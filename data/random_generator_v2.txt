How do the people in your group think during the week? Do they ever talk about Magic other than when it's ""the rest of the week?"" Are there any games? Do they play a few of the same games regularly? Do they play in the same hotel? Do you always know how to ask random questions, or have you done this previously before?

Do you see your group any differently during the week? Do you notice that your group has been mostly quiet all week?! This is not because of the weather!

Do you see other Magic players as being less in touch with the game than the rest of the community, or are they more prone to have conversation than you do about Magic? Do you find others that share things with you but are less present in the group?

Do you play some Magic regularly at home? Are you going out to dinner every night and ask people about Magic more than you do about other people?

Do you have any other Magic-related issues that would help support everyone through the weeks to come? Have you been there already? Do you want someone to take a look? How do you make sure nothing goes wrong in the group? Thanks so much, guys! Howdy!
